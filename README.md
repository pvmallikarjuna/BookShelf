# BookShelf
Built a bookshelf type of app using ReactJS
Bookshelf let's you categorise the books you currently reading or would like to read in future. 
On click of buttons on the page - the book would be moved accross the category you wish to place.
The Search shows you the book related to it.

Pending : Build Search functionality to only searched items. It should appear as a new route. Update to better design and style later.
